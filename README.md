# Leaf Disease Detection Masking Image Processing
 This MATLAB script preprocesses and segments leaf images to highlight diseased areas. By converting images to HSV color space, it applies color-based masking and morphological operations to isolate affected regions in healthy, unhealthy, and very unhealthy leaves. The process aids in visualizing disease patterns for further analysis.
